 # Health isn’t shaped by one factor alone—it’s the result of many things working together, from how we move and eat to how we manage stress and feel about our care. This project takes a closer look at those everyday influences by analyzing datasets provided by our professor. 

 # Project Structure and Purpose
  This project is organized into four main sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of health: demographics and lifestyle, cardiovascular risk, nutrition and body composition, and wellness trends over time. Each section uses a different dataset, all provided by our professor, and applies appropriate statistical tools to explore relationships between variables such as stress, physical activity, BMI, dietary habits, and vital signs.

  The purpose of this structure is to take a well-rounded look at what influences a person’s health—not just from one angle, but from multiple connected perspectives. By breaking down the project into focused parts, we’re able to study patterns more clearly and draw meaningful insights. In the end, the goal is to better understand how different factors work together to shape health outcomes and how this information can be used to support better care, behavior change, and personal well-being.
